# XRInputExamples

Uses Unity3D 2019.3
A few examples of Unity's XR Input System. Started with @dilmerv's original commit, added 'release' readings on his script, then decided to build a couple new scenes by adapting scripts from @fariazz and @icave_user in this Unity forum: https://forum.unity.com/threads/any-example-of-the-new-2019-1-xr-input-system.629824/

None of the three scenes were quite as robut as I needed for my typical use cases, so I took everything I've learned so far about Unity XR Input and made my own single script, "XR Controller Input" that should handle most needs across different VR devices. It also has keyboard debug mode that fires the same as the controller inputs.

I hope this is useful!
